# Global Finance Dashboard

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based financial dashboard that provides real-time market data visualization and analysis. The application fetches financial data from Yahoo Finance and displays interactive charts and metrics for various financial instruments including stocks, indices, and other market data.

## System Architecture

- AI-powered fundamental analysis with multiple valuation frameworks

**Backend**: Python-based data processing and fetching layer
- Yahoo Finance API integration for market data and fundamental financial statements
- OpenAI GPT-5 integration for AI-powered fundamental analysis
- PostgreSQL database for historical data storage, market alerts, and analysis caching
- Caching layer for performance optimization (5-min for market data, 1-hour for fundamentals)
- Error handling and logging for robustness

**Database**: PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- Financial data storage with automatic data type conversion
- Market alerts system with price triggers
